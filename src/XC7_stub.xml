<introduction><p>This is a stub for Part 2 of Applied Discrete Structures. To see the whole chapter, visit our web page at http://faculty.uml.edu/klevasseur/ADS2.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will consider some basic concepts of the relations that are called functions. A large variety of mathematical ideas and applications can be more completely understood when expressed through the function concept.</p></introduction>



<theorem xml:id="theorem-composition-of-injections"><title>The composition of injections is an injection</title><statement><p>If <m>f: A \rightarrow  B</m> and <m>g : B \rightarrow  C</m> are injections, then <m>g\circ f : A \rightarrow  C</m> is an injection.</p></statement></theorem> 

<theorem xml:id="theorem-composition-of-surjections"><title>The composition of surjections is a surjection</title><statement><p> If <m>f : A \rightarrow  B</m> and <m>g: B \rightarrow C</m> are surjections, then <m>g\circ f: A \rightarrow  C</m> is a surjection.</p></statement>

<exercise number="7" xml:id="exercise-counting-functions"><statement> <p>If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are finite sets, how many different functions are there from <m>A</m> into <m>B</m>?</p>
</statement>
<answer><p> For each of the <m>\lvert A \rvert </m> elements of <m>A</m>, there are <m>\lvert B \rvert</m> possible images, so there are<m>\lvert B \rvert\cdot \lvert B \rvert\cdot \ldots \cdot \lvert B \rvert=\left\lvert B \rvert^{\lvert A \rvert}\right.</m> functions from <m>A</m> into <m>B</m>.</p>
